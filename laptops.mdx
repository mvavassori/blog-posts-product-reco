In an era where laptops are central to work, school, and entertainment, investing in a quality model pays dividends through years of daily use. It's surprising how some balk at spending for a better laptop, yet think nothing of buying luxury vehicles that sit idle 95% of the time. For a device you may use 8+ hours a day, upgrading key components goes a long way. In this guide, we‚Äôll cover what to look for when shopping for the best laptop in 2023 and we'll pick the best choice for most people in the end.

## Most Important Features to Consider

### Efficiency

Look for newer generation CPUs that use hybrid efficiency cores for a balance of high performance and longer battery life compared to older generations. Efficient chips get more done per watt.

### Performance

RAM determines how many browser tabs and programs you can run simultaneously without slowdowns. 8GB is passable for basic needs but 16GB or more is better for power users, creative work and gaming.

### GPU Performance

While not critical for basic needs, a good discrete GPU vastly improves visuals for gaming, video editing, 3D work etc. Integrated graphics are fine for non-intensive tasks.

### Battery Life

Getting long battery life is crucial for use away from an outlet. Look for rated runtimes over 10 hours for all-day work, especially with efficient screens, CPUs, and optimized software.

### Build Quality

Durable premium materials like aluminum, carbon fiber and magnesium alloys allow the chassis to endure daily use and travel without added bulk. Sturdy hinges and a glass trackpad also boost quality.

### Heat Dissipation

Effective ventilation cutouts and heat pipes draw heat away from components, preventing reductions in performance. Some laptops transfer heat into the chassis for dissipation over a larger surface area. Quality thermal design improves longevity.

### Fan Noise

Overactive cooling fans that ramp up and down can be distracting. Look for laptops with quiet, efficient fans that maintain steady airflow without loud whirring (or no fans at all üòâ).

## Best Laptops of 2023 for Most People

### Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 11 (14")

  alt="Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 11"
  link="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=lenovo+thinkpad+x1+carbon+gen+11"
/>

#### Highlights:

- Lightweight and durable design (2.48 lbs, MIL-STD-810H durability)
- Excellent keyboard and trackpad
- Powerful Intel processors (up to 12th Gen Core i7)
- Plenty of ports (including Thunderbolt 4, HDMI, and USB-A)
- Display is not as bright as some competitors
- Webcams are not as good as some competitors
- Buyers complain about loud fans and short battery life

#### Technical specifications:

- **Display**: 14-inch IPS display with 1920x1200 resolution, up to 400 nits brightness, 60hz.
- **Processor**: from Intel Core i5-1335U to i7-1370P
- **RAM**: from 16GB LPDDR5 to 64GB LPDDR5
- **Storage**: Up to 2TB PCIe NVMe SSD Gen 4 Performance
- **Graphics**: Intel Iris Xe integrated graphics
- **Operating system**: Windows 11

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon is legendary as a lightweight yet durable business laptop, meeting tough mil-spec durability standards. Where it really shines is allowing buyers to customize exactly the components they need, from basic i5 CPUs and 16GB RAM up to i7 processors and 64GB RAM for power users. That flexibility makes it ideal for business use cases. While its keyboard and trackpad are excellent, some users report the fans run loudly and battery life is just decent compared to alternatives like the MacBook Air. So it's built like a tank but not necessarily the longest-lasting daily driver.

  alt="Dell XPS 15"
  link="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=dell+xps+15"
/>

#### Highlights:

- Gorgeous InfinityEdge display (up to 4K resolution, OLED panel optional)
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX graphics (optional)
- Long battery life
- Thunderbolt 4 ports
- Expensive
- Can be heavy and bulky (4.5 lbs)
- Webcam is not as good as some competitors (still at 720p)

#### Technical specifications:

- **Display**: 15.6-inch InfinityEdge display with 1920x1200 resolution (base model) or touch display 3.5k OLED (optional)
- **Processor**: Core i7-13700H, or Core i9-13900H
- **RAM**: from 16GB LPDDR5 to 64GB LPDDR5
- **Storage**: 512GB, 1TB, or up 8 TB (2 x 4 TB), M.2, PCIe NVMe, SSD
- **Graphics**: from Intel Arc A370M Graphics with 4GB GDDR6 to NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070, 8 GB GDDR6
- **Operating system**: Windows 11

There's a lot to love about the Dell XPS 15, especially the gorgeous near borderless InfinityEdge display. Opt for the 4K OLED panel and your videos will look stunning. Just know that going for the top-end Core i9 CPU may be overkill - some owners say it runs uncomfortably hot. The i7 models are still speedy and run cooler for daily use. Otherwise, the XPS 15 nicely balances speed and battery life. But all those pixels do require some compromises - expect a heavier chassis and lofty price tag.
