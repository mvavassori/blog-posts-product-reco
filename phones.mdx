Don't break the bank. As a beginner, look for an entry-level or mid-range road bike in the $500 to $1,500 range. Opt for an endurance bike designed for comfort over long distances. They have a relaxed geometry ideal for new riders. Choose comfort and value for money. Focus on the frame, fork and components for quality without paying a premium. Take test rides to find the right fit."
