If you're new to running, one of the most important things you can do is choose the right running shoes. **A good pair of running shoes can help you avoid injuries and improve your performance**. But with so many different running shoes on the market, it can be tough to know where to start.

This blog post will help you choose the best running shoes for your needs as a beginner. We'll cover the different types of running shoes available, the features to look for in a beginner running shoe, and some of the best daily trainers on the market.

## Types of Running Shoes

There are two main types of running shoes: daily trainers and racing shoes. Daily trainers are designed for everyday running and offer a balance of support, cushioning, and flexibility. Racing shoes are designed for speed and are typically lighter and less supportive than daily trainers.

### Features to Look for in a Beginner Running Shoe

When choosing a beginner running shoe, there are a few key features to look for:

- **Cushioning:** Running can be hard on your joints, so it's important to choose a shoe with good cushioning. Cushioning can help absorb the impact of each stride and protect your joints from injury.
- **Support:** Beginner runners often have flat feet or overpronate (roll their feet inward too much) when they run. If you have either of these conditions, you'll need a shoe with good support to help prevent injuries.
- **Flexibility:** Running shoes should be flexible enough to allow your feet to move naturally. A stiff shoe can make it difficult to run efficiently and can lead to injuries.

## Where do we get our recommendations from?

Our recommendation come from real people reviews who have tried and reported their experience. Most of our recommendations took inspiration from respected wikis in the industry, such as the respected **r/RunningShoeGeeks** subreddit [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/wiki/index/).
